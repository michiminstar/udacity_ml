# Project: Finding Donors for *CharityML*

This is the first project of the Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree at Udacity.
The goal of this project is create a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 by employing several supervised algorithms of my choice.


The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.
